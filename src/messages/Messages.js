    aboutDescription: `My name is Joey Shi and I am a mathematician and software developer. My interest in code began with a hobby of making simple math programs that would implement numerical algorithms or generate aesthetic plots. I continue exploring and learning through my studies at UBC, working as a developer at Visier, and making my own projects. A few subjects that captivate me right now are mathematical analysis, <a href="https://coolgames.joeyshi.tech" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit">game programming</a>, and machine learning.`,
